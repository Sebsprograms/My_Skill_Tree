# My skill tree

An app for tracking your progress in your skills much like a game stat screen. 

The user would create a skill like programming or fitness, select a progression difficulty and a few activities. 
Activities can be added or removed any time and they are the way you gain EXP towards your skills level. 
An activity has a reward, cooldown, title and skill it belongs to. 

An example would be 
I have a skill called Programming and my activities are: 

Activity: Make 1 commit
Reward: Tiny (5 exp)
Cooldown: 30 minutes
------------
Activity: Finish a course
Reward: Huge (100 exp)
Cooldown: 7 Days
------------

There will also be an activity log and stats screen to help you track your progress in each skill by completing your set activities.
